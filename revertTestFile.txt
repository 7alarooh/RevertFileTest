This File to test the revert for commit

To revert a commit in Git, 
you can use the git revert command.
This command creates a new commit that undoes the changes introduced by a specific commit,
while preserving the project's history.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Steps to Revert a Commit:
1. Identify the commit you want to revert
2. Revert the commit: Use the git revert command followed by the commit hash.
3. Resolve merge conflicts (if any)
4. Push the changes

Example:
# Show commit history
git log

# Revert a specific commit (example commit hash)
git revert abc1234

# Push the revert commit
git push origin main

Reverting the Last Commit:
If you want to revert the most recent commit (HEAD), you can simply do:
git revert HEAD
This will undo the latest commit.
